A luxurious pet garment, designed in a traditional Vietnamese or East Asian style, made entirely of lustrous silk. The garment features a high, standing collar with a deep indigo blue base and an intricate, repeating geometric pattern in crisp white. The upper body is predominantly a rich, deep reddish-brown (maroon). The short sleeves are also maroon, with vibrant royal blue rolled cuffs.

On the front, an inner panel is visible, showcasing a bold, abstract floral pattern with large, stylized flowers in bright pinks, purples, and light blues, set against a multi-colored, patchwork-like background of yellow, teal, green, and orange. Two small, light-colored buttons are visible down the center of this floral panel.

The back of the upper body features a distinct, multi-colored geometric panel across the shoulders, with a vibrant mix of gold, teal, emerald green, purple, orange, and red stripes and blocks.

A solid, bright golden yellow waistband separates the upper and lower sections. The lower skirt flares out with angled edges, featuring a dark, muted background (deep teal/charcoal) adorned with intricate, swirling stylized dragon motifs. The dragons are depicted in vibrant shades of gold, orange, and red, with subtle hints of green and blue, set against a background of darker, swirling cloud or wave patterns. The overall aesthetic is opulent, culturally rich, and visually striking.
